## Welcome to Commentator Kaku's episodes!

Welcome to the first episode of Commentator Kaku. And today we are going to discuss about….a lot of things, which relate to Covid-19. 

Ok so, let me 1st list the things which we are going to discuss today:
1)The graphs of covid-19 and how I got to replicate it.(believe me that’s super fascinating)
2)Predicting the future spread of Covid-19
3) Exams and Covid
4)Why I cannot completely believe everything which the govt. is telling us

And for those who are thinking what is a science video doing inside a channel which is supposed to post musical stuff, then let me tell you that the background music which is ORIGINAL!!!, and hence becomes eligible to feature in a channel of music. And the potato background which you are seeing is also designed by me….I don’t know what struck me while drawing this….huh…..just didn’t want to pull up someone’s art without credit… And if there are any commerce/arts students watching this video, then hang on, Covid is also related to you(I am just giving you an excuse to increase the no. of views on this video) . Enough of commenting non-sense, now let’s get to work.

## Replicating Covid-19 Graphs:

So, for doing this I used knowledge from biology, a bit of mathematics, and class 10 Java programming knowledge. What a dangerous combination!! O I also forgot to mention a bit of common sense and a lot of trial and error were also involved.
Okay, so we have an aim that we have to construct Covid-19 statistics graphs, mathematically, but they should be as close as possible to reality.
So, in dealing with this we have to first channel out the path to it:

### 1st step: 
Understand the biological significance of the spread.
### 2nd step: 
Try to write it down mathematically, in some kind of formula
### 3rd step : 
Use that formula in a program and let it, self-generate values. Self generating values would  lead to lower human interaction, and hence your test whether your mathematical model for the spread is correct or not would be less biased..Now see if you want to be biased even then, then you can..but it does not serve our purpose, so there’s no use speaking about it.
